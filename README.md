# Lemmatizer

A modest script for identifying dictionary forms of morphological
forms in a text by the use of a full form lemma list.  It can also
create an *index verborum* for the text. It currently assumes the
scheme of Stephanus-pages known (among others) from classical editions
of the works of Plato.
